# Work Day Scheduler

This is a work day scheduler designed to work from day to day. It comes with nine slots for an 8 hour work day, from 9 to 5. At the top of the page, the current day is tracked.

Each time block is checked against moment.js and is color-coded depending on the time of day it is. Gray if the time has passed, red if the time matches the current time block and green if the time block has yet to pass.

To add a task, simply click on the colored time block of choice and a text area will appear. Enter a desired task and click on the save icon to the right of the time block. The task will be saved to local storage until cleared.
